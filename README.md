## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS flex
- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

Following CSSLine rules I added backup colors in a SASS list .I also learned to use a SASS mixin to update flex-basis for different column/row sizes .


### Continued development

I already validated my HTML and CSS in [validator] (https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea) , and now pay attention to CSSLint rules as well.  I also need to improve accessibility following ARIA conventions more closely by focusing on landmarks.
I also now follow BEM naming conventions for SASS variable names.
